# What should I think about?

Computers are pseudo-intelligent beings that are just limited in what they do.
A brain is an electricity-powered machine that performs calculations at an 
astounding speed.

# What is code?

As you may have heard programmers say, they use "languages". "javascript", "python", "php", "html", "css".

Let's explore that concept. A language is a tool used by humans to communicate with each other. Maria talks to João. They speak portuguese. "oi, tudo bem?"

Friedrich talks to Hanna. They speak german. "..."

Luo talks to Xie. they speak chinese. "..."

To non-speakers, another language is not understandable, as well.

Code, is a generic name for all languages. "code" is a system of symbols that is capable of transmitting meaning between two communicants.

## Letters
Further the example: let's think about the experience of writing a letter. João wants to tell Maria some beautiful ideas. He writes her a letter.

Those ideas are in his mind. When he sits down to write, he attempts to put his ideas in words. After writing down, he puts the letter inside an envelope and sends it to Maria's address and hopes that whenever Maria opens the letter and reads it to herself,
all the words (the code) bring up to her mind the exact same ideas João had when writing the letter.

The language must be capable of expressing ideas and communicating them.
The language is capable of doing so due to it's `code` characteristic.

## Machines as `characters`

Javascript|HTML|CSS is a language spoken by "browsers". A document written in Javascript is 
understood by Browserers.

Us, as humans, if we wish to communicate with the browser, we need to understand
javascript.

# What is a program?

So, do you cook?
When cooking we grab all ingredients and then follow a series of instructions,
do operations using all the ingredients.

A program is a series of instructions directed at a computer. 
A line of "javascript" is an instruction that tells the computer what to do.
