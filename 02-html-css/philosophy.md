# What is it?

Everything inside the browser's screen is a block.
Blocks may contain other blocks inside them.

Blocks have a start `<block>` and an end `</block>`.

Some blocks are so small that they cannot have anything inside them,
thus they do not need an start and an end, just one block itself `<block>`.

Some blocks are invisible, they only define some "metadata" (not only, but let's ignore that for now)

The main block of a web-page, is the `<html>...</html>`
